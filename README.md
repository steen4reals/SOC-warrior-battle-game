To make this game we will be creating a `Warrior` class, and writing methods in `Program.cs`

## Warrior Class

This class will need a constructor to take in Name

**State**

- Name
- Health
- MaxAttack
- MaxBlock

**Behavior**

- `GetAttack`
  - return a random int between 0 and MaxAttack
- `GetBlock`
  - return a random int between 0 and MaxBlock
- `ApplyDamage`
  - take in damage and subtract from health returning nothing

## Methods in Program

- For each of the following operations, print as appropriate like in the example output.

### HandleAttack

- This method should take in two warriors (warriorA and warriorB)
- From warriorA get an attack
- From warriorB get a block
- Calculate damage to warriorB (attack - block)
- If the damage is greater than 0
  - apply the damage to warriorB

### Battle

- This method should take in two warriors (warrior1 and warrior2)
- Within a while loop that runs continuously
  - call your `HandleAttack` method with warrior1 and warrior2
  - if warrior2 health is less than zero
    - break the loop
  - call your `HandleAttack` method with warrior2 and warrior1
  - if warrior1 health is less than zero
    - break the loop

### Main

- create two new warriors with names of your choice
- call the `Battle` method with your two warriors

## Bonus Task

- Take in names before you commence battle
- Alter the warrior constructor so that you can change the Health, MaxAttack and MaxBlock when instantiating.
- Go Crazy! Use your imagination to use what you've learnt to add to the story and the game.
